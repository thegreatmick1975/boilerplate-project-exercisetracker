# Exercise Tracker

This is the boilerplate for the Exercise Tracker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker
I took this boilerplate and solved problems line by line to make this an actual working exercise tracker complete with logs, dates, exercises and dates. This was quite challenging but very fun
